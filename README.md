C# -assignments-
Here are my assignments in C# course, which I am taking right now on 2023 spring season.

In first assignment I have created three random matrixes. The code is able to sum them, substract them and multiply them and print the result.

In the second assignment I have created an application which reads information of customers and their flights. It is also able to crete a new customer and flight.

In the third assignment I have created an application which returns correct information and lists them in ascending order based on their price values. I have used ==, <, ++ and -- operators.
